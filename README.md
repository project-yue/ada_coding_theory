analysis of Huffman Code
This was developed for Algorithm Design and Analysis at AUT. This is an implementation for Huffman Code
<p>The software comes with ABSOLUTE NO WARRANTY</p>
<p>This Huffman Code implementation works for symbol code from ASCII table. Both compression and decompression processes require Huffman tree construction. The implementation uses adaptive approach. The header records the occurence for each symbol code. A better idea could use code word to replace the frequency, so that for decompression, the tree construction can be ommited. </p>
